Authors: Kevin Fitzgerald, significant contributions: ChatGPT(FitzgeraldKevinSort.java), Rene Urias(MergeSort.java),Jonathan Wang(QuickSort.java), Sam Rebelsky(Testing files, interfaces, documentation)
This repository has a number of sorting algorithms which can sort generic arrays, but are not necessarily stable. Some programs were partially written with others, as noted above, and a large chunk of FitzgeraldKevinSort.java was 
written by ChatGPT as a learning experience as reflected upon within FitzgeraldKevinSort.java. The interface framing and documentation structure as well as some of SorterTests.java was provided by Sam Rebelsky.
